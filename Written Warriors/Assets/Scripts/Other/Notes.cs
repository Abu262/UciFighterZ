/*
All scripts that relate to players go in the PlayerStuff

All CharacterChild scripts go in the Resource folder. If you dont put them there I will hunt you and I will hurt you verbally.

Any other scripts go in the Other folder

Prefabs go in Prfabs Folder and Art goes in art folder and Scenes go in Scenes folder




Designer goals: 
Create new characters for the game! The goal is to get 1-2 characters in the game




Programmer goals: 
Get a GameManager and Character Select Screen, If our progress is good then a main menu is nice too.

Timer in game, a health system that isnt a UI text box


Make the interaction when someone gets hit sexier (slow mo and a better pushback system.


Art:
    Art is gonna be rough, so we want to get art strike going ASAP
    
    Each character has:
        Idle animation
        Walking Animation (back and forth?)
        Crouching Animation
        Blocking Still image
        High attack animation
        LowAttack animation
        Medium Attack Animation
        Special Attack Animation

        Yea I know it's alot

        For attacks I'm thinking a wind up which is just a still image (like a guy winding up his fist) and then the attack, and then a quick cooldown



    apart from that a character select background and a stage would be cool
